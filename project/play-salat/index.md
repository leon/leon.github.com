[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/leon/play-salat.png)](http://travis-ci.org/leon/play-salat)

## Installation

Use g8 to start a new salat enabled play project

### Install g8 on OSX using homebrew
    
    brew update && brew install giter8

Or read about the other ways to install [giter8 here](https://github.com/n8han/giter8)

Then run

    g8 leon/play-salat.g8

It will ask you a couple of questions, and your ready to rock 'n roll.

### Manual installation
Start by adding the plugin, in your `project/Build.scala`

    val appDependencies = Seq(
      "se.radley" %% "play-plugins-salat" % "CHECK_GITHUB_FOR_LATEST_VERSION"
    )

Then we can add the implicit converstions to and from ObjectId by adding to the routesImport and add ObjectId to all the templates

    val main = PlayProject(appName, appVersion, appDependencies, mainLang = SCALA).settings(
      routesImport += "se.radley.plugin.salat.Binders._",
      templatesImport += "org.bson.types.ObjectId"
    )

We now need to register the plugin, this is done by creating(or appending) to the `conf/play.plugins` file

    500:se.radley.plugin.salat.SalatPlugin

We continue to edit the `conf/application.conf` file. We need to disable some plugins that we don't need.
Add these lines:

    dbplugin = disabled
    evolutionplugin = disabled
    ehcacheplugin = disabled

## Configuration
now we need to setup our connections. The plugin is modeled after how plays DB plugin is built.

    mongodb.default.db = "mydb"
    # Optional values
    #mongodb.default.host = "127.0.0.1"
    #mongodb.default.port = 27017
    #mongodb.default.user = "leon"
    #mongodb.default.password = "123456"

	# MongoURI
	# ~~~~~
	# a MongoURI can also be used http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Connections
	# mongodb.default.uri = "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017,mongodb.org:1337/salat-test"

	# WriteConcern
	# ~~~~~
	# Can be any of the following
	#
	# fsyncsafe - Exceptions are raised for network issues and server errors; Write operations wait for the server to flush data to disk.
	# replicassafe - Exceptions are raised for network issues and server errors; waits for at least 2 servers for the write operation.
	# safe - Exceptions are raised for network issues and server errors; waits on a server for the write operation.
	# normal - Exceptions are raised for network issues but not server errors.

	#mongodb.default.writeconcern = "safe"

	# Replica sets
	# ~~~~~
	# http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Why+Replica+Sets
	#
	# To user a replicaset instead of a single host, omit optional values and use the configuration below instead.
	# Since replica sets use public key authentication, user and password won't work together with the replicaset option.

	#mongodb.default.replicaset {
	#    host1.host = "10.0.0.1"
	#
	#    host2.host = "10.0.0.2"
	#    host2.port = 27018
	#}

## More that one DB?
If you would like to connect to two databases you need to create two source names

    mongodb.myotherdb.db = "otherdb"

Then you can call `mongoCollection("collectionname", "myotherdb")`
